## Overview
Linguistic typology is a field of *linguistics* that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features in order to compare them. 

Classifications that are the most common are based on **phonological, morphological,** or **syntactical** criteria. 

In linguistic typology, a *linguistic universal* is an essential concept. Universals are generalizations that apply to all languages, and may either be **absolute** or **implicational**. However, the exceptions - called **tendencies** - are more significant for linguists. 

In order to understand what can and cannot occur in human language, it is important to study dying languages, as what we classify as universals might turn out to be tendencies.

## History

The Modistae school published speculations of a universal grammar underlying all languages in the Middle Ages. 
The cross-linguistic dimension of linguistics was established in the Renaissance, with examples of English, Swedish, Lappish, Irish, Welsh, Basque, Quechua, and Chinese. 
Missionary linguistics produced first-hand word lists and grammatical descriptions of exotic languages, and Franz Bopp and Wilhelm von Humboldt developed comparative works. 

August Wilhelm Schlegel made a classification of the world's languages into three types: 
1. languages lacking grammatical structure, e.g. Chinese; 
2. agglutinative languages, e.g. Turkish; 
3. inflectional languages, which can be synthetic like Latin and Ancient Greek, or analytic like French. 

This idea was later developed by others including August Schleicher, Heymann Steinthal, Franz Misteli, Franz Nicolaus Finck, and Max Müller. The word 'typology' was proposed by Georg von der Gabelentz in his Sprachwissenschaft (1891). 

SIL International, which currently provides a list of live languages as an online database - **Ethnologue**, grew to dominate typology based on missionary linguistics over the twentieth century. 

Typology is done within the frameworks of:
- functional grammar including Functional Discourse Grammar, 
- Role and Reference Grammar,
- Systemic Functional Linguistics. 

However, during the early years of the twenty-first century the existence of linguistic universals became questioned by linguists proposing evolutionary typology.

## Morphological typology
Morphological classifications are based on how a language's morphology works, that is, how words are created, joined, and inflected (if they are). 

There are four types of morphologies that languages use: 
-	**Analytic languages** 
    are not inflected, that is, nouns and adjectives are not declined and verbs are not conjugated. Instead, the order of the words determines grammatical relationships. English and Chinese are analytical languages, though not perfectly so because there are some agreement markers, tenses, etc. in English and words are so little inflected in Chinese. Both English and Chinese rely on syntax - word order, to show grammatical relationships. 

-	**Inflectional languages**
    are different from analytic languages because they inflect a lot. A good example is Latin, in which most words are marked up and down for all kinds of tenses, moods, cases, agreements, and more. When the words in the sentence are inflected to show agreement with all their subjects, objects, and other arguments, then word order becomes very fluid. 

-	**Agglutinative languages** 
    are those in which words can be combined easily. For example, instead of saying the shoe of the horse, agglutinative languages say horseshoe. Agglutinative languages include German and Turkish. This kind of morphology is called productive because new words are formed in a predictable manner. 

-	**Polysynthetic languages**
    are the least understood by linguists. The reason is that none of the major written languages in the world today are polysynthetic. Examples are Native American languages, such as Navajo, and some Polynesian languages. Words, especially verbs, in these languages tend to become very long because every argument in a sentence is inflected for e.g. on the verb. These languages are very difficult to learn because they are not properly understood, and also because one verb may have hundreds of inflections. 

In fact, no natural language falls into a single group, but all are combinations of more than one.


## Phonological typology

Phonological typology is a subfield of linguistics that focuses on the study of the phonological systems found in languages around the world. Phonology refers to the study of the sounds and sound patterns of language. Phonological typology seeks to identify and classify the various ways in which sounds are organized in different languages.

The goal of phonological typology is to uncover patterns and regularities in the phonological systems of languages and understand the range of possibilities that exist across languages. 

Phonological typology employs a comparative approach, analyzing a wide range of languages to identify similarities and differences in their phonological structures. By examining a diverse set of languages, researchers can identify universal tendencies as well as language-specific patterns.

This classification helps linguists understand the distribution and frequency of certain phonological patterns across languages.
Typological studies often categorize languages into different types or classes based on their phonological characteristics. For example, languages may be classified as having vowel-rich systemss. Or classificaction of phones, as some phones are more likely to be contrastive, whereas others typically join with other phones to form a single phoneme. Some phones occur frequently, while others are less likely to occur.

One of the common phonemes is **/t/**. 

It is present in the vast majority of languages, with the exception of Hawaiian. 

Phonological typology is an important field for understanding the diversity of human language and contributes to our understanding of how sounds and sound patterns are organized in different languages. It provides valuable insights into the range of possibilities and constraints in human speech production and perception.

## Syntactic typology

It distinguishes languages acccording to their word order in a sentence. The order of the subject, object, and verb is considered. This provides six potential orderings: 
1) SOV,
2) SVO, 
3) VSO, 
4) OSV, 
5) OVS,
6) VOS. 

The most common orders are **SOV** and **SVO**, present in about 40% of languages, with **VSO** in about 15%. 
In the remaining five percent of languages there is the object before the subject.

English and Mandarin Chinese are exampless of languages with **SVO** order. 
In Mandarin, the simple sentence:

**(1a) Wǒ kàn shū 

(1b) I read book** 

shows the same order as English, starting with the subject and the direct object after the verb. 

By contrast, the **SOV** order is found in languages such as Hindi/Urdu, Japanese, and Korean. 

In the Japanese sentence:

**(2a) Watashi-ga hon-o yomimasu 

(2b) I.subj book.obj read.polite**

the verb appears at the end. 

Some linguists have claimed that these orders are generalizations a parameter on headedness (the head of a phrase is the word which determines its type). According to this theory the verb serves as the head of a verb phrase containing it and the object, and the subject joins this phrase to create a sentence. By this logic languages with right-headedness are **SOV**, and those which are left-headed are **SVO**. 
However, **VSO** languages, such as Classical Arabic, Welsh, and Tagalog, cause problems for this theory. 

Consider the Welsh sentence: 

**(3a) Siaradodd Lloyd y Gymraeg 

(3b) speak.past Lloyd DEF Welsh**

It is not immediately clear how the verb could combine with the object to form a phrase without also combining with the subject. It is clear that word order typology is important for understanding how sentences are parsed, and the topic could be elaborated on.
