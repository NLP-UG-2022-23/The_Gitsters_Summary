## Overview
Linguistic typology is a field of *linguistics* that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features in order to compare them. 

Classifications that are the most common are based on **phonological, morphological,** or **syntactical** criteria. 

In linguistic typology, a *linguistic universal* is an essential concept. Universals are generalizations that apply to all languages, and may either be **absolute** or **implicational**. However, the exceptions - called **tendencies** - are more significant for linguists. 

In order to understand what can and cannot occur in human language, it is important to study dying languages, as what we classify as universals might turn out to be tendencies.
