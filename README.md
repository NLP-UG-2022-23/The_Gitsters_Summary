## Overview
Linguistic typology is a field of *linguistics* that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features in order to compare them. 

Classifications that are the most common are based on **phonological, morphological,** or **syntactical** criteria. 

In linguistic typology, a *linguistic universal* is an essential concept. Universals are generalizations that apply to all languages, and may either be **absolute** or **implicational**. However, the exceptions - called **tendencies** - are more significant for linguists. 

In order to understand what can and cannot occur in human language, it is important to study dying languages, as what we classify as universals might turn out to be tendencies.

## History
![Language](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSbgDa11qhUakWUAlApDsSygjL30SHNqdOC8w&usqp=CAU)

The Modistae school published speculations of a universal grammar underlying all languages in the Middle Ages. 
The cross-linguistic dimension of linguistics was established in the Renaissance, with examples of English, Swedish, Lappish, Irish, Welsh, Basque, Quechua, and Chinese. 
Missionary linguistics produced first-hand word lists and grammatical descriptions of exotic languages, and Franz Bopp and Wilhelm von Humboldt developed comparative works. 

August Wilhelm Schlegel made a classification of the world's languages into three types: 
1. languages lacking grammatical structure, e.g. Chinese; 
2. agglutinative languages, e.g. Turkish; 
3. inflectional languages, which can be synthetic like Latin and Ancient Greek, or analytic like French. 

This idea was later developed by others including August Schleicher, Heymann Steinthal, Franz Misteli, Franz Nicolaus Finck, and Max Müller. The word 'typology' was proposed by Georg von der Gabelentz in his Sprachwissenschaft (1891). 

SIL International, which currently provides a list of live languages as an online database - **Ethnologue**, grew to dominate typology based on missionary linguistics over the twentieth century. 

Typology is done within the frameworks of:
- functional grammar including Functional Discourse Grammar, 
- Role and Reference Grammar,
- Systemic Functional Linguistics. 

However, during the early years of the twenty-first century the existence of linguistic universals became questioned by linguists proposing evolutionary typology.

## Morphological typology
Morphological classifications are based on how a language's morphology works, that is, how words are created, joined, and inflected (if they are). 

There are four types of morphologies that languages use: 
-	**Analytic languages** 
    are not inflected, that is, nouns and adjectives are not declined and verbs are not conjugated. Instead, the order of the words determines grammatical relationships. English and Chinese are analytical languages, though not perfectly so because there are some agreement markers, tenses, etc. in English and words are so little inflected in Chinese. Both English and Chinese rely on syntax - word order, to show grammatical relationships. 

-	**Inflectional languages**
    are different from analytic languages because they inflect a lot. A good example is Latin, in which most words are marked up and down for all kinds of tenses, moods, cases, agreements, and more. When the words in the sentence are inflected to show agreement with all their subjects, objects, and other arguments, then word order becomes very fluid. 

-	**Agglutinative languages** 
    are those in which words can be combined easily. For example, instead of saying the shoe of the horse, agglutinative languages say horseshoe. Agglutinative languages include German and Turkish. This kind of morphology is called productive because new words are formed in a predictable manner. 

-	**Polysynthetic languages**
    are the least understood by linguists. The reason is that none of the major written languages in the world today are polysynthetic. Examples are Native American languages, such as Navajo, and some Polynesian languages. Words, especially verbs, in these languages tend to become very long because every argument in a sentence is inflected for e.g. on the verb. These languages are very difficult to learn because they are not properly understood, and also because one verb may have hundreds of inflections. 

In fact, no natural language falls into a single group, but all are combinations of more than one.


## Phonological typology
![Language](https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/23/82/52/360_F_523825285_V1VpTchVXflx690Ympul4Qlwq404Ggpy.jpg)

Phonological typology is a subfield of linguistics that focuses on the study of the phonological systems found in languages around the world. Phonology refers to the study of the sounds and sound patterns of language. Phonological typology seeks to identify and classify the various ways in which sounds are organized in different languages.

The goal of phonological typology is to uncover patterns and regularities in the phonological systems of languages and understand the range of possibilities that exist across languages. 

Phonological typology employs a comparative approach, analyzing a wide range of languages to identify similarities and differences in their phonological structures. By examining a diverse set of languages, researchers can identify universal tendencies as well as language-specific patterns.

This classification helps linguists understand the distribution and frequency of certain phonological patterns across languages.
Typological studies often categorize languages into different types or classes based on their phonological characteristics. For example, languages may be classified as having vowel-rich systemss. Or classificaction of phones, as some phones are more likely to be contrastive, whereas others typically join with other phones to form a single phoneme. Some phones occur frequently, while others are less likely to occur.

One of the common phonemes is **/t/**. 

It is present in the vast majority of languages, with the exception of Hawaiian. 

Phonological typology is an important field for understanding the diversity of human language and contributes to our understanding of how sounds and sound patterns are organized in different languages. It provides valuable insights into the range of possibilities and constraints in human speech production and perception.

## Syntactic typology
![syntax](https://linguaholic.com/linguablog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Defining-Syntax.jpeg)

It distinguishes languages acccording to their word order in a sentence. The order of the subject, object, and verb is considered. This provides six potential orderings: 
1) SOV,
2) SVO, 
3) VSO, 
4) OSV, 
5) OVS,
6) VOS. 

The most common orders are **SOV** and **SVO**, present in about 40% of languages, with **VSO** in about 15%. 
In the remaining five percent of languages there is the object before the subject.

English and Mandarin Chinese are exampless of languages with **SVO** order. 
In Mandarin, the simple sentence:

**(1a) Wǒ kàn shū**

**(1b) I read book** 

shows the same order as English, starting with the subject and the direct object after the verb. 

By contrast, the **SOV** order is found in languages such as Hindi/Urdu, Japanese, and Korean. 

In the Japanese sentence:

**(2a) Watashi-ga hon-o yomimasu 

(2b) I.subj book.obj read.polite**

the verb appears at the end. 

Some linguists have claimed that these orders are generalizations a parameter on headedness (the head of a phrase is the word which determines its type). According to this theory the verb serves as the head of a verb phrase containing it and the object, and the subject joins this phrase to create a sentence. By this logic languages with right-headedness are **SOV**, and those which are left-headed are **SVO**. 
However, **VSO** languages, such as Classical Arabic, Welsh, and Tagalog, cause problems for this theory. 

Consider the Welsh sentence: 

**(3a) Siaradodd Lloyd y Gymraeg 

(3b) speak.past Lloyd DEF Welsh**

It is not immediately clear how the verb could combine with the object to form a phrase without also combining with the subject. It is clear that word order typology is important for understanding how sentences are parsed, and the topic could be elaborated on. 


# Phonetics

![Language](https://www.eposts.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/language.jpg)

## Introduction
People often overlook the sounds they produce and the subtle distinctions they carry. Unfortunately, it is not surprising that language-learning resources rarely use technical terms to describe foreign sounds. Learners often receive unhelpful advice such as "pronounce it more crisply." By classifying language sounds, we can move closer to understanding *the essence of human communication.*

The study of speech sound production and perception is a branch of linguistics known as phonetics. The examination of how languages treat these sounds is called phonology. Although these two fields overlap significantly, it is apparent that they differ in crucial ways.

Phonetics is the systematic exploration of human capabilities in creating and perceiving sounds using the vocal organs, particularly for oral language production. 

Phonetics is divided into *three branches*: 

- **articulatory,**
- **acoustic,** 
- **auditory.**

Phonology, on the other hand, is the formal investigation of sound systems (phonologies) in languages, particularly the universal properties found in all languages.

**The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)** is a vital tool used in phonetics and phonology. It is a standardized representation of the sounds employed in human languages.  Familiarizing yourself with the IPA and being able to read and write it will enhance your understanding of spoken language.

## Phonetic transcription and the IPA

The division of speech in a language into distinct units, is frequently employed for convenience. These units are somewhat identifiable portions within the continuous flow of speech. However, it is important to acknowledge that this segmentation of speech is artificial, as both the articulation and acoustic signal of speech are continuous. Furthermore, any attempt to classify segments intentionally overrlooks certain details, as no two segments produced at different times are ever identical. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, segmentation remains an essential tool in nearly all areas of linguistics. The most basic segments according to phonetics are called phones:

*"**Phones** may be defined as units in speech which can be distinguished acoustically or articulatorily."*

In many contexts phones may be thought of as acoustic or articulatory targets which may or may not be fully reached in actual speech. 
It is crucial to understand that segments, although they may be relevant in phonology, do not correspond to acctual components of speech produced in the vocal tract. Realized speech is a highly co-articulated process that involves movement and the spreading of sound aspects across entire syllables and words. While it is convenient to conceptualize speech as a sequence of segments for the purpose of discussing it in written form, actual phonetic analysis of speech challenges such a model. It is important to note, however, that if we aim to represent the dynamic and intricate nature of speech through static writing, segmental constructs serve as useful abstractions to convey our intended representation. 



**The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)** is a system of phonetic notation which provides a standardized system of transcribing phonetic segments up to a certain degree of detail. It may be represented visually using charts. For now just be aware that text in square brackets [] is phonetic transcription in IPA. We will reproduce simplified charts of different subsets of the IPA here as they are explained.

Variations of IPA such as the well established **Americanist phonetic notation** and a new, simplified international version called **SaypU** are available, but IPA is more comprehensive and so preferred for educational use, despite its complexity.

To understand the IPA's taxonomy of phones, it is important to consider articulatory, acoustic, and auditory phonetics. 

## Articulatory phonetics
<!-- Tomasz Wąs -->
<!-- Streszczenie wstępu sekcji -->
Articulatory phonetics studies how the vocal apparatus produces language sounds. There are two types of sounds: consonants and vowels. The distinguishing property of consonants is constriction of (or closing) the vocal tract. The characteristic property of vowels is limited constriction - the vocal tract is open. Vowels carry much of the pitch of speech; consonants, on the other hand, do not carry the prosodic pitch (especially if devoiced and not nasalized); they do not have the potential for the durations that vowels have. 'Semi-vowels' or 'semi-consonants', such as [w], seem more like a vowel (vocal tract more open); phonologically speaking, they behave like consonants - they appear before a vowel at the beginning of a syllable. 
### Consonants
![Places of articulation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/Places_of_articulation.svg/192px-Places_of_articulation.svg.png)

_A diagram of the vocal tract showing the places of articulation_

One can distinguish consonants by _place of articulation (POA)_ and _manner of articulation (MOA)_. _POA_ is "where" the consonant is produced, while _MOA_ is "how" the consonant is produced.
Shown below are different _POA_: 
* **Bilabial** - lips held together (the [p] sound of the English _**p**in_, the [b] sound in _**b**in_).
* **Labiodental** - holding the upper teeth to the lower lip (the [f] sound of English _**f**in_).
* **Dental** - the tongue making contact with the upper teeth (area 3 in the diagram) (the [θ] sound in the word _**th**in_).
* **Alveolar** - the tongue touching the alveolar ridge (area 4 in the diagram) (the [t] in _**t**in_ and [s] in _**s**in_).
* **Postalveolar** - the tongue touching area 5 in the diagram (like the [ʃ] of _**sh**in_).
* **Palatal** - articulated at the hard palate (area 7 in the diagram) (the [j] in the word _**y**oung_).
* **Velar** - articulated at the soft palate (area 8 in the diagram) (the [k] in the word _**k**in_).
* **Glottal** - articulated at the glottis (area 11 in the diagram) (the [h] may be regarded as glottal).
* **Doubly articulated** have two _POA_ (the labio-velar [w] of _**w**it_).

Types of manner of articulation:
* __Voicing__ is the rapid vibration caused by the vocal folds.
* __Nasality__ - some sounds are produced with airflow through the nasal cavity. In most languages nasals are voiced.
* __Obstruency__ - stops or plosives are consonants involving a total obstruction of airflow. Fricatives are consonants with a steady stricture causing friction. Affricates begin with a stop-like closure followed by frication.
* __Sonorancy__ - non-obstruents are classed as sonorants (for example nasals). Approximants are sounds in which articulatory organs produce a narrowing of the vocal tract, but leave enough space for air to flow.

Below is the simplified IPA table of the consonants of English. MOA is organized in rows and POA columns. Voicing pairs occur in the same cells; sounds in bold are voiced while the rest are voiceless. 

__Simplified IPA consonant chart (for English)__
|  | 	Bilabial<br>(or Labio-velar) | Labiodental | Dental | Alveolar | Postalveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Plosive** |	p __b__ |  |  | t __d__ |  | | k __g__ |
|**Fricative** 	|  | f __v__ | θ __ð__ | s __z__ | ʃ __ʒ__ | | | h |
|**Affricate** |  |  |  |  | tʃ __dʒ__ |
|**Nasal** 	| __m__ |  |  | __n__ |  | | __ŋ__|
|**Approximant** 	| w |  |  | ɹ l |  | j |
### Vowels
![Tongue positions](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Cardinal_vowel_tongue_position-front.svg/240px-Cardinal_vowel_tongue_position-front.svg.png)

_Tongue positions of cardinal front vowels with highest point indicated. The position of the highest point is used to determine vowel height and backness_

We can divide vowels into sets of features based on three variables:
* __Height__ is how close the tongue is to the roof of mouth.
* __Backness__  is where the tounge is located in mouth horizontally.
* __Rounding__ is the shape of the lips during articulation.

Back vowels tend to be rounded, front vowels unrounded. However, this is not universal - the French word bœuf is what would result from the vowel of the English word bet pronounced with rounding. Some East and Southeast Asian languages possess unrounded back vowels.

The cardinal vowels are a set of idealized vowels used by phoneticians as a base of reference.

The vowel diagram roughly represents the diagram of the mouth, with the left being the front, the right the back, and the vertical direction representing height in the mouth. Each vowel is positioned based on height and backness. Rounding isn't indicated by location; however, when pairs of vowels share the same height and backness, the left is always unrounded, and the right rounded. The following is a simplified version of the IPA vowel chart: 

![Vowel chart](https://www.translationdirectory.com/images_articles/wikipedia/vowel_chart.gif)

The following are rough examples (from General American English):

| **[æ]** |   c*a*t   | __[ɑ]__ | c*o*t    | __[ɐ]__ | c*u*t    |
|:-------:|:---------:|:-------:|----------|:-------:|----------|
| **[ɛ]** |   k*e*lp  | __[ə]__ | carr*o*t | __[ɔ]__ | c*au*ght |
| **[e]** |   c*a*ke  | __[o]__ | c*oa*t   | __[ɪ]__ | k*i*n    |
| **[ʊ]** | c*u*shion | __[i]__ | k*ee*p   | __[u]__ | c*oo*l   |

## Other types of phonetics
### Acoustic phonetics

Acoustic phonetics deals with the physical medium of speech - sound waves .Sound consists of waves that move through the air, alternating between areas of high and low pressure. A fundamental perspective on sound is to consider it as a wave function, where the pressure recorded by a device is plotted against time, reflecting the physical characteristics of sound. By examining the amplitude of the sound at a specific moment, we can determine its loudness.

This method has its limitations. The human ear, in fact, analyzes sound by breaking it down into its individual frequencies using a mathematical algorithm called the Fourier transform.

When a sound is produced in the oral tract, the column of air in the tract acts as a harmonic oscillator, simultaneously oscillating at various frequencies. Some frequencies are at higher amplitudes than others, which is referred to as resonance. In phonetics, these resonant frequencies of the vocal tract are known as **formants**. 
The formants in a speech sound are numbered based on their frequency: 
- the lowest frequency is represented as *f1*, 
- followed by f2, 
- f3, 
- and so on. 

There are two basic ways to analyze the formants of a speech signal:
1) At any given time the sound contains a mixture of different frequencies of sound. The relative amplitudes (strengths) of different frequencies at a particular time may be shown as a frequency spectrum. The **frequency** is plotted against **aplitude**, and formants show up as peaks:

![frequency_specctrum](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dMSUt.png)

2) Another way to view formants is by using a **spectrogram**. This plots **time** against **frequency**, with amplitude represented by darkness. Formants show up as dark bands, and their movement may be tracked through time.

![spectrogram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Spectrogram_-iua-.png)
**Spectrogram** of American English vowels [i, u, ɑ] showing the formants f1 and f2

Given the development of modern technology, acoustic analysis is now accessible to anyone with a computer and a microphone.

### Auditory phonetics

![auditory](http://phiallfish.chez.com/und_essays/comm.gif)

*source:* http://phiallfish.chez.com/und_essays/Phonetics.html

Auditory phonetics is a branch of phonetics concerned with the hearing of speech sounds and with speech perception. 
The relationship between *auditory sensations* and the *physical properties of sound* that generate them is not direct. While the physical properties, which are objectively measurable, exist, auditory sensations are subjective and can only be examined through the reports provided by listeners regarding their perceptions. 
The following table displays certain connections between physical properties and auditory sensations:

| Physical property | 	Auditory perception |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| amplitude or intensity |	loudness |
|fundamental frequency 	| pitch |
|spectral structure |	sound quality|
|duration 	|length |

*source:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_phonetics

Auditory phonetics is concerned with both **segmental** (chiefly vowels and consonants) and **prosodic** (such as stress, tone, rhythm and intonation) aspects of speech. 
While it is possible to study the auditory perception of these phenomena in isolation, in connected speech, they are processed simultaneously with significant variability and complex interactions between them. These interactions have been observed in the context of continuous speech, where variables like vowels, typically distinguished by the frequencies of their formants, also exhibit inherent variations in fundamental frequency (and therefore pitch) based on *vowel height*. 
For instance, **open vowels generally have lower fundamental frequencies** compared to close vowels in a given context. As a result, vowel recognition is likely to be influenced by the perception of prosody.

### As a learner

![languages](https://soarbehaviorwa.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/creativity-thegem-blog-default.jpg)

**Within their first year**, children acquire the sounds specific to their native language, making it challenging for them to produce sounds that are foreign to their language later on. 
Even familiar segments are produced without conscious consideration of their how they are produced. Consequently, it is strongly advised to practice pronouncing isolated segments and regurarly listen to examples of sounds that appear unfamiliar. Over time, you will find yourself becoming more attentive to the phonetic elements you encounter in your daily life, and you will be less puzzled by unfamiliar elements in other languages.

# Historical Linguistics
_based on:_ [Wikibooks article](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics/Historical_Linguistics)
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_linguistics)

Historical linguistics is the diachronic study of language or other words how language develops through ages into its current form. The discipline itself originates from early **philology** and observations regarding the relatedness of the Romance languages. From these humble beginnings, in the 18th century the first real method of historical linguistics was developed, comparative linguistics. This method was built upon the relations between languages. It wanted to reconstruct the proto-languages and rebuild the families they belonged to. Thus, the proto-indo-european was reconstructed. The reconstruction would change through the years, the methodology would however stay the same. There were several principles this science followed, some of the most important were the **majority principle** and the **most natural development principle**. The former stating that if in a group of related words a feature is prevalent, then this feature was probably in the older language. The latter pointing out that there are some general changes, which are quite common and usually the most probable ones.

The reconstructions usually rely very heavily on sound changes. These can materialize in a few different ways, as: **metathesis**, **epenthesis**, **prosthesis**, **assimilation**, **lenition**. There are also two types of change, one coming from the language itself called *internal change*, one coming from other languages called *external change*. At the very beginning, the sound changes were crucial for the discipline concluding in the creation of the **Neogrammarian school**, which believed that laws of these sound changes present absolute scientific laws, which have no exceptions. They wanted to see linguistics as a natural science instead of a humanistic science. 

One of such laws, which was very important for both comparative linguistics and neogrammarians, was the **Grimm's law**. This law describes a sound shift that illustrates how proto-indo-european turned into proto-germanic. In the most basic terms it can be described thusly: voiceless stops become voiceless fricatives, voiced stops become voiceless stops, voiced aspirated stops become voiced stops or fricatives. Grimm himself was not a neogrammarian, his law however illustrates a very regular sound change, which the neogrammarians would be looking for everywhere. 

![Jakob Grimm](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/JacobGrimm.jpg)

Jakob Grimm

Another important branch of historical linguistics was etymology. It is a science trying to explain the origin of words. It is also very closely related to the latter two. It has however a facet not explored by them, the meaning. When words undergo sound changes, they sometimes go through semantic shifts as well. These can be described by the following processes: 
- narrowing, 
- widening, 
- metonymy, 
- synecdoche, 
- metaphor, 
- hyperbole, 
- meiosis. 

It also examines how exactly words enter into the lexicon, some of the recognized processes are **loaning**, **derivation** or the combining of the two, **coinage**, etc.
The neogrammarians’ and generally historical linguistics’ place in the spotlight was not to be. Ferdinand de Saussere, who studied in Leipzig with many neogrammarians and whose most famous article during his life was about comparative linguistics (see *laryngeal theory*), would soon end its reign. A post-mortem publication of notes from his lectures *Course in General Linguistics* would posit a distinction between synchronic and diachronic linguistics and signified the birth of a new leading school of thought, structuralism (Although a similar distinction was also proposed earlier by a pole Jan Baudouin de Courtenay). **Synchronic linguistics** would go on to become the primary branch, while diachronic linguistics would become an important but still secondary branch.

![Course in General Linguistics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/Cours_de_linguistique_g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale.jpg)

Course in General Linguistics

The branch, although smaller, would stay quite prolific, creating important and interesting research. Nowadays the branch is moving more and more in the direction of syntax with research on **grammaticalization**. 

Another important development was presented by sociolinguistics. The dialects and varieties were always important in historical research, but the sociolinguistic perspective would add a more nuanced view of society and its influence on language change.


# Neurolinguistics
_based on:_ [Wikibooks article](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics/Neurolinguistics)
[Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurolinguistics)

## Overview
Neurolinguistics takes its roots in the 19th century. It studies the connections between the brain and language. The basis of the branch are the few areas in the brain broadly responsible for language and speech: **Broca’s area**, **Wernicke’s area**, **Arcuate fasciculus** and **the motor cortex**. It also considers specific brain responses like **N400** or **P600**.

![The brain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Brain_Surface_Gyri.SVG)

Brain with the Broca's area, Wernicke's area, Arcuate fasciculus and the motor cortex higlighted

### Approaches
There are also a few general theories pertaining to what exactly goes on in these areas. 
- **Localism** states that different areas have different functions. 
- **Associationism** which states that the connections between the areas is what matters. 
- **Dynamic localisation of functions**, which states that the functions are localized in the areas, but the connections are also crucial. 
- **Hierarchical approach** which sees the functions split evolutionally, the more basic ones in the more basic parts of the brain, the more advanced ones in the more advanced parts of the brain. 
- **The holistic approach** where the brain is treated as one big tool. 

### Aphasiology
A very important area of research are the different ailments, which can influence one’s command of languages. There are two types of those, the *acquired* and *developmental language disorders*, the former starting from birth, the latter developing during the person’s life. One of the disorders, which is of the most interest for neurolinguistics is **Aphasia**, brain damage in a particular area, which affects speech production and understanding. Depending on the area it affects the abilities in different ways.

## Experiments
As neurolinguistics is a very interdisciplinary science, it very often is tasked with checking the theoretical assumptions of other sciences, like psycholinguistics. Thus the experiment design is crucial. There are many different methods and techniques.

### Methods
There are two main methods of detecting activity in the brain. 
- **Hemodynamic**, checking, where exactly the blood collects in the brain during the tests. These are usually performed through a *PET* or an *fMRI* scan. 
- **Electrophysiological**; neurons in the brain create a current which can be measured through *EEG* (sensors attached to the head measure the current) or *MEG* (where the magnetic fields produced by the current are measured). 

### Techniques
When it comes to the techniques, these are the most important: 
- **Subtraction** – concerns the fMRI method, tries to compare the heatmaps of similar linguistic and non-linguistic actions. 
- **Mismatch paradigm** – concerns the electrophysiological method, introduces a deviation in a string of exact same stimuli. Mainly used for study of phonetics.
- **Violation-based** – introduces a violation in an otherwise grammatical phrase or word and sees, what exactly the brain does with it.
- **Priming** – testing whether the words are connected to each other in the brain through reaction time.
- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation** – outputting a powerful magnetic field in order to disrupt our own magnetic field and seeing how it impacts a person or an animal.

During such experiments there are also a variety of tasks that the subjects perform to see how their brain reacts during.

# Sociolinguistics
**Sociolinguistics** is the descriptive study of the effect of aspects of society (cultural norms, expectations, context) on the way language is used, and the effects of language on society. Sociolinguistics studies the correlation between the **social variable** (ethnicity, religion, status, gender, level of education, class) and the **linguistic variable**. Usage of a language varies from place to place and among social classes (sociolects). Central to the discussion of sociolinguistics is **style** - a set of linguistic variables that correspond to a certain value of a social variable. 

## Speech Communities

Speech communities can be members of a profession with a specialized jargon, distinct social groups or groups like families.

A **social network** is a way of describing a particular speech community in terms of relations between individual members. A social network may apply to the macro level (a country or a city) but also to the inter-personal level (neighborhoods or a family). Modern examples of social networks can be formed by the Internet, organizations etc.

A network could be **loose** or **tight** depending on how cloesly members interact with each other. A **multiplex** community is one in which members have multiple relationships with each other. The looseness or tightness of a social network may affect speech patterns adopted by a speaker.

Closely related to the concept of speech communities is **register** - a style of language used in a specific context (a field of study, a profession). Different speech speech communities often develop specific vocabulary for their own use:
* **Jargon** - is a type of specialised language used inside an established social group.
* **Slang** - is a type of colloquial language used outside established social groups.
    * **Taboo term** (i.e. profanity) - is a type of language usually considered impolite.
        
## Prestige

The concept of **prestige** is crucial for sociolinguistics. Speech habits are assigned a positive or a negative value which is then applied to the speaker. This can operate on two levels:
* It can be realised on the level of the individual phoneme. The post-vocalic /r/ is used among the upper class and avoided by the lower class in the USA, but the situation is reversed in England.
* It can be realised on the macro scale of language choice, as realised in the various **diglossias**.

We distinguish two types of prestige:
* **Overt prestige** - assigned to language features associated with the upper class.
* **Covert prestige** - assigned to language features associated with the lower class.

**Class aspirations** affect the choice of style. Lower-class people who wish to move upwards in the social ladder will likely adjust their speech habits to resemble speech with high overt prestige. Sometimes we can observe hypercorrection.

### Bernstein's Code Theory
#### Social language codes

Basil Bernstein created a social code system which he used to classify the speech patterns for different social classes. Two codes he created are:
* **Restricted code**
* **Elaborated code**

#### Restricted code

Restricted code is a speech pattern used by the working-class. This code allows strong bonds between group members, who behave based on distinctions such as'male', 'female', 'older', and 'younger'. This social group often uses language without explicit meaning, as their shared knowledge and common understanding unite them. The restricted code emphasizes 'we' as a social group, fostering greater solidarity than 'I'. This type of communication is particularly important for children starting school, where the standard variety of language is used.

Children with restricted code struggle more at school than those who speak an "elaborated-code" (the written form of a language can be very different from the everyday form). Working class's type of communication reminds Paivio's dual code theory, which suggests equal weight to verbal and non-verbal processing. The use of context by working-class members may be a "non-verbal code," but this type of communication may not be understood by other children or teachers. It is suggested that working-class children should receive pre-school training in their early childhood to acquire the valid speaking style at school.
#### Elaborated code
Basil Bernstein studied the 'elaborated code', used by middle and upper classes for education and career advancement. The bond between these social groups is not well defined, and social identity is based on individual disposition and temperament. Tasks are not clearly divided by sex or age, and members negotiate roles rather than having them pre-made. Elaborated code requires individual intentions and viewpoints to be made explicit as the 'I' has a greater emphasis with this social group than the working class.

### Deviation from standard language varieties
The existence of differences in language between social classes is presented below: 
| Bristolian Dialect<br>(lower class) | Standard English<br>(higher class) |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| I ain't done nothing             | I haven't done anything         |
| I done it yesterday              | I did it yesterday              |
| It weren't me that done it       | I didn't do it                  |

The differences in grammar between the two examples of speech is referred to as differences between sociolects.

### Covert prestige
Non-standard language is commonly perceived as low-prestige language. However, standard language may be considered undesirable in many contexts in certain groups. Working class dialect is a powerful in-group marker; the use of non-standard varieties can express pride and group/class solidarity.

## Style shifting

### Speech Accommodation
### Internal vs. external language
In Chomskian linguistics, there is I-language (internal language) and E-language (external language). Internal language applies to the study of syntax and semantics in language on the abstract level; as mentally represented knowledge in a native speaker. External language applies to language in social contexts, i.e. behavioral habits shared by a community.

## Sociolinguistic interview
**Sociolinguistic interviews** are an integral part of collecting data for sociolinguistic studies. Listed below are are five types of collecting data:
* **Minimal pairs** (MP): The most formal style would be elicited by having the subject read a list of minimal pairs.
* **Word list** (WL): Having the subject read a WL will elicit a formal register (not as formal as MP).
* **Reading passage** (RP).
* **Interview style** (IS) - eliciting a more casual speech from the subject. The interviewer can converse with the subject and draw out more casual sort of speech.
* **Casual style** (CS): Difficult to elicit because of the Observer's Paradox. The subject will adjust his or her speech because of the presence of the linguist, and will switch to a more formal style. CS is used in a completely unmonitored environment where the subject feels most comfortable and will use their natural vernacular without overtly thinking about it.
