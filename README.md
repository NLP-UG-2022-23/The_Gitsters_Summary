## Overview
Linguistic typology is a field of *linguistics* that studies and classifies languages according to their structural features in order to compare them. 

Classifications that are the most common are based on **phonological, morphological,** or **syntactical** criteria. 

In linguistic typology, a *linguistic universal* is an essential concept. Universals are generalizations that apply to all languages, and may either be **absolute** or **implicational**. However, the exceptions - called **tendencies** - are more significant for linguists. 

In order to understand what can and cannot occur in human language, it is important to study dying languages, as what we classify as universals might turn out to be tendencies.

## History

The Modistae school published speculations of a universal grammar underlying all languages in the Middle Ages. 
The cross-linguistic dimension of linguistics was established in the Renaissance, with examples of English, Swedish, Lappish, Irish, Welsh, Basque, Quechua, and Chinese. 
Missionary linguistics produced first-hand word lists and grammatical descriptions of exotic languages, and Franz Bopp and Wilhelm von Humboldt developed comparative works. 

August Wilhelm Schlegel made a classification of the world's languages into three types: 
1. languages lacking grammatical structure, e.g. Chinese; 
2. agglutinative languages, e.g. Turkish; 
3. inflectional languages, which can be synthetic like Latin and Ancient Greek, or analytic like French. 

This idea was later developed by others including August Schleicher, Heymann Steinthal, Franz Misteli, Franz Nicolaus Finck, and Max MÃ¼ller. The word 'typology' was proposed by Georg von der Gabelentz in his Sprachwissenschaft (1891). 

SIL International, which currently provides a list of live languages as an online database - **Ethnologue**, grew to dominate typology based on missionary linguistics over the twentieth century. 

Typology is done within the frameworks of:
- functional grammar including Functional Discourse Grammar, 
- Role and Reference Grammar,
- Systemic Functional Linguistics. 

However, during the early years of the twenty-first century the existence of linguistic universals became questioned by linguists proposing evolutionary typology.
